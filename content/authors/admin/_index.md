Hello! I'm EJ!, a passionate Data Scientist who thrives at the intersection of data, technology, and problem-solving. With a decade of experience in this vibrant field, I've developed a knack for transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive strategic business decisions.
My journey in data science began with a Pentium IV computer in 1995 that allowed me to work with earliest version of Microsoft Excel!. I quickly learned about how to bring data, create charts and even develop out-of-the-box linear regression. I carried all these skills with me throghout my studies in the university where I worked on various projects that required data manipulation, analysis and publications. I have mastered R in my PhD, where I developed econometrics models for prediction of house property values. 
All I have learned by myself were not enough, so I have recently completed a M.S. in Data Science (a joint program with Gothenburg and Chalmers universities). This strong academic foundation, coupled with practical experience, has allowed me to hone my skills in areas like Machine Learning, Predictive Modelling, Data Visualization, and Big Data Analytics. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working in diverse industry settings. My quest for unraveling the hidden patterns in data has led to successfully enhancing business operations, improving customer experiences, and predicting market trends.

My technical toolkit is extensive, incorporating languages such as Python, R, and SQL, along with expertise in platforms like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hadoop, and Tableau. A believer in constant learning, I'm always seeking to update my skills and stay abreast of the latest industry advancements.But beyond the algorithms and code, my true passion lies in storytelling. Data, in my eyes, is a narrative waiting to be discovered and shared. I aim to demystify the complexities of data and present it in a way that is not only comprehensible but also actionable for decision-makers.When I'm not knee-deep in data, I enjoy hiking, reading about cognitive science, and exploring the local coffee scene. I'm also an avid supporter of women in tech, dedicating part of my time to mentoring aspiring female data scientists.Welcome to my little corner on the web, where I share my projects, thoughts on data science trends, and resources for fellow data enthusiasts. I'm excited to connect, collaborate, and keep pushing the boundaries of what data can achieve.

Thank you for stopping by!
