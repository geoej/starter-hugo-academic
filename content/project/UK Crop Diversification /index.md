Project description: This project aims to promote crop diversification in the United Kingdom to improve the resilience and nutrition security of the country's food supply. The researchers developed a systematic framework to assess the suitability of a wide range of crops, including both major crops and underutilized/neglected crops, across the UK using climate, soil, and other relevant data. An initial suitability analysis was performed on over 1,800 crops at 2,800 locations, followed by a more detailed evaluation and ranking of 56 top candidate crops based on factors like nutritional value, adaptability, and production potential. This shortlisting process identified promising crops such as bulbous barley, sea buckthorn, and blue lupin that could be incorporated into more diversified UK farming systems.

My role: I developed the overall analysis framework, combining geospatial data, crop databases, and multi-criteria evaluation methods to determine the most climate-resilient and nutritious crop options for the UK. This involved processing large datasets, applying spatial modeling techniques, and collaborating with domain experts to validate the findings. The project's significance was recognized through its selection for presentation to HRH Princess Ann, highlighting the potential contribution to UK food and nutrition security.

Highlight: The systematic and data-driven approach used in this project to identify suitable underutilized crops represents an innovative application of agricultural data science principles. The shortlisted crops offer promising alternatives that could enhance the diversity and resilience of UK agriculture in the face of climate change challenges.
