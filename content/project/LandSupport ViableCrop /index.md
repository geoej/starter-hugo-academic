LandSupport ViableCrop is a groundbreaking project that falls under the umbrella of sustainable land management. Its goal is to develop a comprehensive framework for assessing the feasibility of introducing new land uses. This framework takes into account economic viability, potential climate impacts, and detailed land suitability analysis. The project leverages the power of geospatial data analysis techniques using R and Google Earth Engine, showcasing their utility in this domain.

My role in this project was multifaceted. I developed a multifaceted land suitability analysis approach for feasibility assessment based on data from various sources, including MySQL databases and Google Earth Engine. I performed detailed mapping and land use planning using R Geospatial packages. Additionally, I conducted feasibility assessments for profitability and return on investment (ROI).

The highlight of this project is the first-ever end-to-end feasibility analysis for a new land use option that includes economic projections and climate change considerations. This project has the potential to revolutionize land management practices by providing a robust framework for assessing the viability of new land uses and ensuring sustainable land use planning for the future.
