The LandSupport CropDivMap project is a pioneering initiative that employs a data-driven approach to identify underutilized crops (UCs) with potential for sustainable agricultural diversification in Italy. This innovative project falls under the umbrella of agricultural data science and spatial planning for sustainability, leveraging data analysis techniques to identify UCs that can promote a more resilient and sustainable agricultural system in Italy.

Through this project, we aim to provide a data-driven solution to support the diversification of crops in Italy, enhancing the country's agricultural sustainability and resilience. By analyzing extensive datasets, we can identify UCs that are well-suited to specific regions, promoting biodiversity, reducing environmental impact, and supporting local farmers.

As the project lead, I developed a novel methodology for shortlisting UCs with potential for sustainable agricultural diversification across Italy. This approach has been published in a prestigious journal, highlighting the project's significance in the field of agricultural data science and spatial planning for sustainability.

The project's outcome is a comprehensive map showcasing the potential for crop diversification in Italy, paving the way for a more sustainable agricultural future. This map is the first of its kind in a European country, providing a valuable resource for policymakers, farmers, and researchers working towards a more resilient and sustainable agricultural system.
