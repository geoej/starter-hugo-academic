As an Agritech & NLP Integration project, AgroLingua aims to bridge the gap between structured agricultural data and large language models. By leveraging over 2.5 GB of agricultural data and the capabilities of the Gemini large language model, this project seeks to generate human-readable insights that can be beneficial for the agricultural domain. This innovative approach combines the strengths of agricultural technology and natural language processing to provide valuable information for farmers, researchers, and policymakers.

The project's primary objective is to develop an online interface on AWS that can accurately generate adaptation measurement recommendations for any location. This will be achieved by integrating the domain-specific knowledge from the structured agricultural data with the Gemini language model. The outcome of this project will be a powerful tool that can provide actionable insights for the agricultural sector, enabling more informed decision-making and sustainable practices.

As the project progresses, it is expected to have a significant impact on the agricultural sector by providing farmers and agricultural professionals with the knowledge and tools they need to adapt to changing climate conditions. By harnessing the power of AI and NLP, AgroLingua has the potential to revolutionize the way agricultural data is used and interpreted, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and food-secure future.
