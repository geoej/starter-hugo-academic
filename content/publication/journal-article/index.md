abstract: "Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a multipurpose industrial crop which is mainly cultivated in temperate regions. With its high potential for economic returns for its seeds and fiber, there is growing interest in cultivating hemp in many territories including Malaysia and other Asian countries, where its cultivation is currently illegal. To date, no comprehensive study on the suitability of this crop under Malaysian conditions has been conducted. In this paper, we propose an assessment framework as a roadmap to develop the hemp industry in Malaysia and possibly other Asian countries with equatorial climates. This framework includes suitability assessment (climate and soil), crop modelling (current and future yields under climate change) and economic analysis (net present value (NPV), NPV benefit (NPVB) and benefit-cost ratio (BCR). The land suitability assessment classified hemp as an adaptable crop for most of the land in the country. The AquaCrop model, parameterised from secondary data collected from literature was used in simulations and potential yield mapping."
